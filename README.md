# field_transect_data

This repo contains shared documentation, data, results, and code for 2024 preliminary field transect data collected in the PHX area.

Datasets are grouped together into folders with comparable datasets. These folders are:
  
  #2024_trial_transects: data collected during summer 2024 when testing out methods for transects. 

Code is structured so that it will run from within the R project associated with the folder that contains the project. Data are pulled from the DeAD Dropbox folder. 

Each dataset folder is structured with the following folders:

**doc**: contains text files with meta-data and other documentation for the project (note that field notes, SOPs, and other detailed documetation should reside in LabArchives with links to the associated GitHub repo and Dropbox folders)

**output**: contains output (e.g., figures, tables) from analyses.

**code**: Source code (.R or .qmd) for analyses and files associated with rendering the code (e.g., html rendering from Quarto files). All analyses for the transect data are in R.
